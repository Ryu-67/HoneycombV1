# Honeycomb
The newest and simplest way to sequence actions on your robot. Developed by Adam from team 25943.

## Why Honeycomb?
Honecomb is extremely lightweight - there are only 3 classes in the library with minimal overhead and an easy to use system.
There are no strings attached either - no subsystem requirement like FTCLib, no entire pathing library attached like RR 1.0, and a much simpler interface than StateFactory.
